      <p>By depositing works in CurateND, you do not surrender any of the rights to your work (such as
         ownership, usage, etc.).
         Depositors must have the rights to submit the work;1 CurateND accepts no responsibility for work
         deposited without the
         appropriate rights. It is also the expectation that depositors will assign access permissions that
         allow the widest use
         possible. If you believe your materials were deposited without appropriate permissions, please
         contact the CurateND
         support team. If you would like assistance in understanding your authorâ€™s agreement, or to learn
         more about what rights
         you have retained, please contact our Scholarly Communications Librarian.</p>

      <p>For more information, view <a href="agreement.html" target="_blank">the submission agreement</a>.
