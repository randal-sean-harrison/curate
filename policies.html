            <p class="mb-4"></p>As part of the Hesburgh Libraries’ mission to connect people to knowledge across time,
            CurateND is
            committed to
            preserving deposits according to preservation practices. For that reason, all materials deposited in
            CurateND will be
            saved in two locations: an access copy maintained by Hesburgh Libraries and a preservation copy stored on
            the
            University’s tape storage system. The tape system will be backed up in Amazon Web Services (AWS), which
            allows all
            materials to have at least two copies stored in different geographical regions.</p>

                <h4>Persistent Identifiers</h4>
              </div>
              <div class="card-body bg-white rounded">

                <p><strong>CurateND Assigned Identifier</strong>&mdash;Every item and file stored in CurateND is given a
                  unique eleven-character identifier. This identifier is permanent, and
                  will never be revoked or reassigned to another work in CurateND. Since the CurateND Identifier is not
                  a URL, it is not
                  automatically resolvable to a web page. CurateND identifiers refer to a specific item but do not make
                  a distinction
                  between versions of that item (e.g. minor corrections to either the files or the metadata). All items
                  are assigned a persistent URL based on the persistent identifier, which follow the pattern
                  <code>https://curate.nd.edu/show/XXXXXXXXXXX</code> where "XXXXXXXXXXX" is the eleven- character
                  CurateND Identifier for the item. This
                  pattern works for both records and files.
                </p>


                <p><strong>Digital Object Identifier (DOI)</strong>&mdash;A DOI is the preferred way to cite materials
                  in
                  CurateND. A DOI can be created free of charge.

                  If an item in CurateND has a CurateND-assigned DOI (i.e., a DOI that points to a CurateND web page as
                  opposed to a
                  publisher’s web page), then that DOI is guaranteed to always point to the item’s page in CurateND.

                  CurateND DOIs will always point to an item’s information page in CurateND and not to any associated
                  files to ensure
                  compliance with the FAIR Guiding Principles for data management. <span class="text-primary"

                  In the event of significant changes to the repository’s level of funding, staffing, or other
                  resources, or in the event
                  that the repository itself ceases to exist, Hesburgh Libraries will make a reasonable effort to
                  continue providing
                  access to deposited content.

                <p>
                  As part of its commitment to providing long-term access to deposited content, CurateND has existing
                  relationships with
                  other trusted digital repositories, such as Academic Preservation (AP) Trust. Hesburgh Libraries and
                  the Office of
                  Information Technology (OIT) continually monitor the digital preservation landscape for other possible
                  solutions which
                  could be used on a contingency basis.
